# üî® This site is under construction!!! 
But... if you want to see it:
https://b-e-sa-arpeggio.netlify.app <br>
Expect major responsive/lag bugs

## Introduction

The main goal for this project was to make an site that looks different than most generic portfolios. <br>
I was super excited to create an API that brings together countless artists, with information about their lives and their artworks.<br> 
So I thought... Why not make such API but also a website that shows it? So this is **Arpeggio**.

## What it does
It's simple, Arpeggio shows to you two main pages:<br>

**Gallery**: shows all artworks and an timeline with their completion dates. <br>
You can hover over the images to see them more closely, and their respective dates.

**Artists**: shows all the artists on the api, with their name and three artworks.
You can click on the artworks to see more info about then, or click on the artist name to go to a page
that shows more informations about him and more two artworks (five artworks in total).
